////////// LAST LEFT OFF:

Why the flip is usedLetters' strlen equal to 31??

Rearranging the struct did something!! Fix problem by doing so?



///////////// NEED TO DO:

Use boolean in EvaluateGuess to know when the players guessed wrong or right.

Iterate through hostWord, if hostWord[i] == guessedLetter, then assign guessedLetter to guesserWord[i]







Noose draw idea:

  -------|
  |      J
  |      O
  |     \|/
  |      |
 _L_    / \


Print a bunch of newlines to put distance between each new guessed
Show a list of used up letters
